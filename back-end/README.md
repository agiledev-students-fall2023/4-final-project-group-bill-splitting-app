# Backend Setup for Our Application

Welcome to the backend part of our application, which uses Express.js. This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up and run the backend on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): Required to run the Express.js server and manage dependencies.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): Comes bundled with Node.js and is used for package management.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the backend server running:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

If you haven't already, clone the main repository to your local machine. Use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agiledev-students-fall2023/4-final-project-group-bill-splitting-app.git
```

Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd back-end
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the necessary Node.js packages for the backend:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Start the Server

Run the following command to start the Express.js server:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will start, typically on `http://localhost:3001`.
