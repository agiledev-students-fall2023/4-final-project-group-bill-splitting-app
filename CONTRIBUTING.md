# Team Norms

Welcome to our Bill-Splitting App! We aim to create a collabortaive and respectful environemt here. Please take a look at our norms:

- We'll have regular meetings to share updates and listen to each other's thoughts and concerns.
- In cases where physcial co-location isn't practical, we emphasize everyone making an effort to show to meetings via video call.

## Team Values

- Each team member will be assigned specific tasks and we will make sure to complete it before the next meeting
- In the event of encountering challenges or needing help, we will consult each other first before notifying a supervisor.
- Conflicts will be resolved through constant communication with one another.
  - In the event of encountering a disagreement on project direction, we will host a duscission for everyone to have the chance to input their opinions and hear each other out.
  - In the event where one or multiple team memebers fail to deliver their obligations, please inform the team about your challenges and we will make necessary adjsutments to keep everything on track.
  - Members are expected to respond to messages by the end of the work day. Communication is key!

## Sprint Cadence

For our project, we have decided that a sprint should last 2 weeks. It's enough time to be able to complete meaningful work while also being short enough to maintain a sense of urgency and focus.

## Daily Standups

Our daily standups will happen on every Tuesday and Thursday at 1:45pm. Each standup will last 15 minutes and we expect all team memebers to be present synchronously, ready to share their progress and or any blockers. Active participation is key so members will not cover for other members who do not participate. If someone consistently doesn't contribute for two consecutive standups, we'll report this concern to management.

## Coding Standards

- We will be using Visual Studio Code.
- Always pull from master before working.
- Always push working code, if you break the pipeline/build then fix it.
- Write self documenting code. Use descriptive variable and function names. Avoid unnecessary name shortening.
- Provide specific commit messages.
