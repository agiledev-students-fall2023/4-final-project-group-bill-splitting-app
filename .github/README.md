# The Group Bill Splitting App

## Description of Project

The Group Bill Splitting App is designed to streamline the process of splitting bills among groups of people. In today's social and financial landscape, individuals often find themselves sharing expenses in various settings, such as dining out, traveling, or living together. This application aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly solution for managing shared expenses, ensuring that everyone pays their fair share effortlessly.

### Product Vision Statement

In a world where coming together and sharing moments are core to our daily lives - whether it's traveling abroad, dining out with friends, going on work trips with colleagues, or handling routine household bills with family - dealing with shared financial responsibilities should be simple and straightforward. Our vision is to introduce a unified platform where handling and dividing shared expenses is as easy as a single click. We aim for an app that makes group financial transactions clear-cut while prioritizing clarity, adaptability, and user comfort. The Group Bill Splitting App is designed to enable users to easily track, manage, and clear their shared expenses, fostering trust and enhancing the pleasure of shared moments without the monetary hassle.
