# Team Norms

Welcome to our Bill-Splitting App! We aim to create a collabortaive and respectful environemt here. Please take a look at our norms:

- We'll have regular meetings to share updates and listen to each other's thoughts and concerns.
- In cases where physcial co-location isn't practical, we emphasize everyone making an effort to show to meetings via video call.

## Team Values

- Each team member will be assigned specific tasks and we will make sure to complete it before the next meeting
- In the event of encountering challenges or needing help, we will consult each other first before notifying a supervisor.
- Conflicts will be resolved through constant communication with one another.
  - In the event of encountering a disagreement on project direction, we will host a duscission for everyone to have the chance to input their opinions and hear each other out.
  - In the event where one or multiple team memebers fail to deliver their obligations, please inform the team about your challenges and we will make necessary adjsutments to keep everything on track.
  - Members are expected to respond to messages by the end of the work day. Communication is key!

## Sprint Cadence

For our project, we have decided that a sprint should last 2 weeks. It's enough time to be able to complete meaningful work while also being short enough to maintain a sense of urgency and focus.

## Daily Standups

Our daily standups will happen on every Tuesday and Thursday at 1:45pm. Each standup will last 15 minutes and we expect all team memebers to be present synchronously, ready to share their progress and or any blockers. Active participation is key so members will not cover for other members who do not participate. If someone consistently doesn't contribute for two consecutive standups, we'll report this concern to management.

## Coding Standards

- We will be using Visual Studio Code.
- Always pull from master before working.
- Always push working code, if you break the pipeline/build then fix it.
- Write self documenting code. Use descriptive variable and function names. Avoid unnecessary name shortening.
- Provide specific commit messages.

## Concluding Statement

Our Group Bill Splitting App, makes splitting bills in a group super easy. In today's world, we often share costs for things like meals, trips, or living expenses. Our app helps manage these shared expenses in a way that's simple and fair for everyone involved. The Group Bill Splitting App is here to simplify this process by giving you a straightforward and user-friendly tool to handle shared expenses effortlessly.

## Git Workflow

- Always pull from master branch before working
- Push each commit with a meaningful message
- Before we incorporate changes into our main branch, a pull request must be made and must be approved by another member.

## Rules of Contribution

Before you start contributing, please keep the following considerations in mind:

- **Adhere to Team Values**: All contributors must adhere to the team values. Any form of inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated.

- **Pull Requests**: Ensure that your pull requests(PRs) are small enough to be reviewed easily. Always provide a concise and informative description.

- **Issues**: If you're working on a particular issue, please comment on it to prevent multiple contributors working on the same problem.

- **Commit Messages**: Write meaningful commit messages that clearly explain the changes made. This helps in understanding the history and purpose of changes.

- **Coding Standards**: Adhere to the coding standards established in this project for consistency.

#### What to Contribute?

- **Bug Fixes**: If you've discovered a bug and know how to fix it, please submit a PR. Make sure to describe the problem and solution in the PR's description.

- **Features**: New features can be proposed by opening an issue. Once it's discussed and approved, you or someone else can start working on it.

- **Documentation**: Improving or correcting the project's documentation is always appreciated.

## Setting up a Local Development Environment

To set up a local development environment, follow these steps:

(Note: Now, we assume that we will have a 'package.json' and the project will use separate npm scripts to launch the back-end and front-end servers. This may change later on. )

1. **Install Dependencies**:

   After cloning the repository and navigating to the project directory, run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Launch the Back-End Server**:

   To start the back-end server, run:

   ```bash
   npm run start-backend
   ```

3. **Launch the Front-End (React.js) Server**:

   To start the front-end server, use:

   ```bash
   npm run start-frontend
   ```

More to add: More instructions will be added as we develop further.
