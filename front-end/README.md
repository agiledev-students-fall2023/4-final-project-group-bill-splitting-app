# Getting Started with Our App

Welcome to our application! This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and run the front-end of our app on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system. This will provide you with the necessary tools like `npm` (Node Package Manager) to install dependencies and run the application.

## Setting Up the Front-End

Follow these simple steps to get the front-end up and running:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

If you haven't already, clone the main repository to your local machine. Use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agiledev-students-fall2023/4-final-project-group-bill-splitting-app.git
```

Navigate to the front-end directory:

```bash
cd front-end
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the required packages using npm. These packages are essential for the app to function correctly:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Start the Application

With all the dependencies in place, start the application by running:

```bash
npm start
```

### Accessing the App

Once the app is running, it will be available in development mode. Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

- The page will automatically reload if you make any changes to the code.
- Any lint errors will be displayed in the console for easy debugging.

## Additional Notes

- **Backend Integration:** Our app includes a backend component as well. For the application to function fully, please ensure that you also set up the backend. You can find the instructions in the [Backend README](../back-end/README.md).

Happy coding!
